      <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to AceSolver, an iOS mobile application (the <strong>“App”</strong>) operated by <strong>AppThemis Technologies Inc.</strong>, a company based in Quebec, Canada (the <strong>“Company”</strong>, <strong>“we”</strong>, <strong>“us”</strong>, or <strong>“our”</strong>). These Terms of Use (the <strong>“Terms”</strong> or <strong>“Agreement”</strong>) govern your access to and use of the App and any related services. By downloading or using AceSolver, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms or are not legally able to agree, you must not use the App.</p>
      <p>Your use of AceSolver is also subject to our <a href="https://legal.acesolver.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference. Please read these Terms and the Privacy Policy carefully. This Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and the Company. If you have any questions, you can contact us as outlined at the end of these Terms.</p>

      <h2 id="account">2. Account Creation & Eligibility</h2>
      <p><strong>App Store Age Rating:</strong> The App’s age rating on the App Store is <strong>4+</strong>. However, features that require an account may only be used with a valid Apple ID. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s consent to use the App and to create or use any account features.</p>
      <p><strong>Sign-In:</strong> To use AceSolver, you may be required to sign in with your Apple ID using “Sign in with Apple.” We receive limited account information (e.g., name and email or an anonymized relay email, depending on your Apple settings). You must ensure this information is accurate and kept up to date.</p>
      <p><strong>Children:</strong> If you are under 13 years old, you may use the App only with your parent or legal guardian’s consent and supervision. We do not knowingly allow a child under 13 to create an account without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has created an account without such consent, we will terminate the account and delete associated data in accordance with our policies.</p>
      <p><strong>Account Security:</strong> Your AceSolver account is tied to your Apple ID. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Apple ID and for any activity that occurs under your AceSolver account. <strong>Do not share access</strong> to your Apple ID or AceSolver account. Notify us promptly of any unauthorized use. We are not liable for loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your credentials.</p>
      <p><strong>Account Responsibility:</strong> You agree not to create an account or use the App if we have previously terminated or banned you. We may refuse registration or cancel accounts at our discretion if a user violates these Terms or is otherwise ineligible.</p>

      <h2 id="subscriptions">3. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
      <p><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> AceSolver may offer premium features through auto-renewing in-app subscriptions (e.g., monthly or annual plans). All subscriptions and payments are handled by Apple’s In-App Purchase system. We do not directly collect or store your payment information.</p>
      <p><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> <strong>Subscriptions automatically renew</strong> unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your App Store account will be charged within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period for the next term. Manage or cancel in <em>Settings &gt; [Your Name] &gt; Subscriptions</em>. Deleting the App does not cancel an active subscription.</p>
      <p><strong>Trials & Promotions:</strong> If offered, free trials begin on activation and run for the stated duration. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your account will be charged and the subscription will renew as described above. We may modify or end promotions as permitted by law.</p>
      <p><strong>No Refunds:</strong> All purchases are final and non-refundable except as required by law or Apple’s policies. Refund requests must be made through Apple.</p>
      <p><strong>Price Changes:</strong> Subscription fees may change. We will provide notice in-app and/or via email before changes take effect on renewal. If you do not agree to the new price, cancel before the next billing date.</p>

      <h2 id="ai-services">4. AI Features and Service Providers</h2>
      <p><strong>AI-Powered Analysis:</strong> AceSolver uses artificial intelligence features to analyze user-provided poker data (e.g., hand histories or scenarios). To deliver these features, the App transmits your inputs to external service providers that process the data and return analytical results.</p>
      <p><strong>Data Handling with Providers:</strong> We instruct our service providers not to use your inputs/outputs to train their public models and to retain request logs only as necessary for abuse prevention, troubleshooting, and legal compliance. Retention periods may be short-term and are governed by each provider’s policies. See our Privacy Policy for details on categories of data shared and purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>Other Operational Services:</strong> The App relies on additional providers for infrastructure such as cloud storage, analytics, authentication, and subscription/entitlement management. These providers process limited personal data on our behalf and under our instructions. We do not share more information with them than is necessary to provide the App.</p>
      <p><strong>No Control Over External Services:</strong> Availability and quality of certain App functions may depend on external services (e.g., platform sign-in or payments). While we select reputable providers, we cannot guarantee continuous availability or error-free operation of third-party services.</p>
      <p><strong>Acceptable Use Alignment:</strong> Your use of AceSolver must comply with this Agreement, App Store rules, and the acceptable-use requirements of our service providers. We may suspend or terminate access if your use violates those requirements or jeopardizes our access to such services.</p>
      <p><strong>AI Output Disclaimer:</strong> AI-generated analysis is for informational and entertainment purposes only and may be incorrect, incomplete, biased, or otherwise unsuitable for your specific situation. Do not rely on it as professional advice. Use your own judgment at all times.</p>

      <h2 id="user-content">5. User Content & Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p><strong>User Content Submissions:</strong> You retain ownership of poker data, scenarios, hand histories, chat messages, and other content you submit (<strong>“User Content”</strong>). By submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, adapt, and transmit your content as necessary to: (a) operate and provide the App (including processing via our AI and infrastructure providers), (b) store it in our systems, and (c) improve and develop products and features. This license continues only as long as needed for those purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>Responsibility for User Content:</strong> You are solely responsible for your submissions and for results derived from them. You represent that you have the rights to provide the content and grant the above license, and that your content does not infringe others’ rights or applicable law. Do not upload illegal, confidential (without authorization), or others’ personal data without consent.</p>
      <p><strong>Our Intellectual Property:</strong> Except for User Content, all content and materials on or through the App—including software, designs, algorithms, text, graphics, and the “AceSolver” name and logo—are owned by AppThemis Technologies Inc. or its licensors and protected by law. We grant you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes as permitted by these Terms.</p>
      <p><strong>AI Output Usage:</strong> To the extent permitted by law, you may use and share AI-generated output for lawful purposes, subject to these Terms. We do not guarantee copyrightability or enforceability of rights in AI-generated content. You agree not to remove any notices included with outputs and not to present outputs as professional or expert advice.</p>
      <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> If you provide suggestions or feedback, we may use them without compensation. We own any improvements developed based on such feedback.</p>

      <h2 id="acceptable-use">6. User Obligations & Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree to use AceSolver lawfully and in accordance with these Terms. You specifically agree you will not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Violate Laws or Rights:</strong> Use the App in any unlawful manner or to facilitate illegal gambling. Comply with all laws applicable to poker or gaming in your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Inappropriate Content:</strong> Submit or attempt to generate content that is obscene, hateful, harassing, threatening, violent, infringing, or otherwise objectionable. We may filter or block disallowed content.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Interference:</strong> Probe, scan, or test vulnerabilities; circumvent security; or introduce malware or harmful code.</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code or underlying algorithms except as allowed by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Resale or Commercial Use:</strong> Rent, sell, sublicense, or use the App to provide services to third parties without our written permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Impersonation/Misrepresentation:</strong> Impersonate others or misrepresent affiliations; do not present AI outputs as statements by a human expert or by the Company.</li>
        <li><strong>Excessive/Automated Use:</strong> Use bots or scripts to send abnormal request volumes or otherwise interfere with normal operation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Violations may result in suspension or termination and may be reported to authorities where appropriate.</p>

      <h2 id="disclaimer">7. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p><strong>No Warranty:</strong> <strong>AceSolver is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company and its affiliates, licensors, and service providers disclaim all warranties, express, implied, or statutory, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and those arising from course of dealing or usage.</p>
      <p><strong>AI Output Discretion:</strong> Use of AI-based analysis is at your own discretion and risk. We make no warranty or representation as to the accuracy or quality of AI-generated output. Do not rely solely on the App’s analysis for important decisions.</p>
      <p><strong>No Guarantee of Results:</strong> We do not guarantee improved poker skills or outcomes. The Company is not responsible for any losses you may incur in real-life poker or other activities, even if you believe they relate to the App’s analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> The App may depend on external services (e.g., platform sign-in, payments, infrastructure). We are not responsible for acts, omissions, downtime, security incidents, or errors of such providers.</p>
      <p><strong>Beta Features:</strong> Any experimental or beta features are provided without warranties and may change or be withdrawn at any time.</p>

      <h2 id="liability">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p><strong>Indirect Damages:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will the Company or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits/winnings, data, goodwill, service interruption, computer damage, or cost of substitutes.</p>
      <p><strong>Direct Damages Cap:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, total liability for any claims under these Terms is limited to the amount you paid us in the last twelve (12) months for use of the App, or <strong>CAD $100</strong>, whichever is greater.</p>
      <p><strong>User Content & AI Outputs:</strong> We are not liable for content you submit or for AI-generated content, even if offensive, erroneous, or harmful. You assume full responsibility for decisions based on the App’s outputs.</p>
      <p><strong>Third-Party Claims:</strong> We are not liable for claims resulting from third-party conduct or unauthorized access to our systems. Your obligations to indemnify us are described below.</p>
      <p><strong>Applicability:</strong> Nothing excludes liability that cannot be excluded by law. These limitations apply even if a limited remedy fails its essential purpose.</p>

      <h2 id="indemnification">9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to <strong>indemnify, defend, and hold harmless</strong> AppThemis Technologies Inc., its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from: (a) your use or misuse of the App; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your User Content or AI-related interactions; or (d) your violation of law or third-party rights. We may assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification, and you will cooperate with us.</p>

      <h2 id="termination">10. Termination</h2>
      <p><strong>By You:</strong> You may stop using AceSolver at any time and may request account deletion via in-app options (if available) or by contacting support.</p>
      <p><strong>By Us:</strong> We may suspend or terminate access, with or without notice, if: (a) you breach these Terms; (b) your use poses security, legal, or operational risk; (c) we discontinue the App or encounter unexpected issues; or (d) a platform or service we rely on restricts our access due to your use.</p>
      <p><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately and we may deactivate or delete your account and data, subject to our Privacy Policy and applicable law. Export any content you wish to keep before deletion.</p>
      <p><strong>Survival:</strong> Provisions that by nature survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, and governing law) continue after termination.</p>

      <h2 id="governing-law">11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the <strong>Province of Quebec</strong> and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.</p>
      <p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Subject to any consumer rights you may have, disputes will be brought exclusively in courts of competent jurisdiction located in Quebec, Canada. We may seek injunctive relief in any jurisdiction to prevent misuse or breaches.</p>
      <p><strong>Language:</strong> The parties confirm their express wish that these Terms and all related documents be drawn up in English. <strong>Les parties confirment leur volonté expresse que la présente convention et tous les documents s’y rattachant soient rédigés en anglais.</strong></p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> If mandatory consumer protections apply in your jurisdiction, they apply in addition to these Terms. In case of conflict, the more protective provision for you as a consumer will apply.</p>

      <h2 id="changes-terms">12. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated Terms in the App and update the “Last Updated” date above. We may also provide additional notice (e.g., email or in-app notice). Changes take effect when posted unless stated otherwise. By continuing to use AceSolver after changes become effective, you agree to the updated Terms. If you do not agree, stop using the App and cancel any subscription.</p>

      <h2 id="contact-terms">13. Contact Information</h2>
